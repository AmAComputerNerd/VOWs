# VOWs
VOWs (Version-Oriented Writing suite, name W.I.P.) is a text and presentation editor that aims to introduce the unique functionality of version control into the writing experience.

Also the project I'll be submitting for my Year 12 Design & Technology course :)

## Q&A
### Why should I use it?
Idk, it's an interesting idea and take on the genre. Unlike Google Docs in which the functionality is *kind of* a feature, my program seeks to embrace it in it's entirety by integrating it with a bunch of other features like Collaboration. Might make things interesting?
### What formats does it support?
In short - I'm not sure yet. Depending on the format of Microsoft Word files, there is a possibility that I provide a way to open these files and convert them to my own format. No promises though. I'll make sure to add support for regular text files (.txt) and rich text files (.rtf) as those are fairly simple to read.
### What language is it written in?
Although development hasn't actually began yet, I'm planning on creating the program using the WPF framework in C#. This gives me both a unique opportunity to learn the ins and outs of C#, and allows me to further experiment with the WPF framework.
#### WPF; What is it?
WPF is a framework for hosting desktop applications using Microsoft Visual C#. It is generally considered the best all-round framework for use, as other options like WinForms are either lacking in essential features, or incredibly limiting in scope, as in the case of UWP.
